<p>A great <a href="http://pablocantero.com">friend of mine</a> suggested me to write my "setup", based on <a href="http://usesthis.com">usesthis.com</a>. At first I thought it was too geeky, but… Well, now I decided to give it a try.</p>

<h2>Who are you, and what do you do?</h2>

<p>My name is Glauber, aka Rodger, and I am a Front End Engineer, a Designer, Web Developer and a want-to-be Entrepreneur.</p>

<h2>What hardware do you use?</h2>

<p>By this time I have an inseparable friend, my good and old 17 inches 1.8Ghz MacBook Pro 2009, with 8GB of RAM and 750GB of hard drive. Still can't figure out why Apple stopped selling the 17" version of MBPro and all the times I went to an Apple Store deciding whether or not to by the new retina-display MBPro, I couldn't try it with the full display resolution I <strong>love</strong> to work with, and 1440x900 wasn't enough for me. Maybe I'll give it another try.</p>

<p>Being a designer would require me to use pencil and paper to draw some mockups but generally I don't use them. Only sometimes when I am creating a logo. Most everything I create goes straight to the screen.</p>

<p>Other hardware I use on a daily basis are the Kindle, an iPhone 4S (Yes, I was strong enough not to buy the new iPhone 5 even after almost one year after its release), the Apple TV, so I can do some screen mirroring and watch my movies and NetFlix. I also have a TimeCapsule where I keep all my data safe. Sometimes I borrow my wife's iPad when I want to read my RSS feeds in a larger screen.</p>

<h2>And what software?</h2>

<p>As a Java Developer, I use Eclipse (and plugins) for developing, deploying, versioning etc. As a Web Developer, I use <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a> for literally everything. As a Designer, Illustrator and Photoshop are my fellows. For writing, I use <a href="http://mouapp.com">Mou</a> but my friend Pablo has been persuading me to try <a href="http://www.iawriter.com/mac">iaWriter</a>.</p>

<p>For FTPing I use the excellent <a href="http://panic.com/transmit">Transmit</a>, for watching movies on the big screen I use <a href="http://beamer-app.com">Beamer</a> (my old MBPro doesn't support native mirroring via Airplay), for books management I use <a href="http://calibre-ebook.com">Calibre</a>. I couldn't forget to mention Dropbox, my favorite cloud storage service. Oh, and I surf with Chrome.</p>

<p>My iTunes is 100% of the time open and playing christian music, bossa nova and a ecletic array of good music (from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9ZGKALMMuc">Sinatra</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QYxuGQMCuU">Michael Bublé</a>, from <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRqI5R6L7ow">Elis Regina</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2BEhk1fqZo">Emily Loizeau</a> and from <a href="http://www.glenhansardmusic.com">Glen Hansard</a> to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGghkjpNCQ8">Calvin Harris</a>).</p>

<h2>What would be your dream setup?</h2>

<p>I couldn't agree more with <a href="http://john.battaglia.usesthis.com">John Battaglia</a>, so I'll use his words: "My dream setup would be what I’m currently working on, but outdoors with fresh air".</p>
